1. The Commercial License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the digital work (Item) you have selected. Read the rest of this license for the details that apply to your use of the Item.

2. You are licensed to use the Item to create one single End Product for yourself or for one client (a “single application”).
>For example: the item is an extension and the end product is the final website customised with your content.


### Things you can do with the Item

4. You can create one End Product for a client, and you can transfer that single End Product to your client for any fee. This license is then transferred to your client.

5. You can modify or manipulate the Item. You can combine the Item with other works and make a derivative work from it. In this case, you can not request support under the provided warranty period.


### Things you can't do with the Item
6. You can’t Sell the End Product, except to one client. (If you or your client want to Sell the End Product, you will need to buy a new License.)

7. You can’t re-distribute the Item. You can’t do this with an Item either on its own or bundled with other items, and even if you modify the Item. You can’t re-distribute or make available the Item as-is or with superficial modifications.

8. Although you can modify the Item and therefore delete unwanted components before creating your single End Product, you can’t extract and use a single component of an Item on a stand-alone basis.
>For example: You license a Module containing libraries. You can delete unwanted libraries from the Module. But you can't extract a library to use outside of the Module.

9. You must not permit an end user of the End Product to extract the Item and use it separately from the End Product.

### Other license terms

10. For some Items, a component of the Item will be sourced by the author from elsewhere and different license terms may apply to the component, such as someone else’s license or an open source or creative commons license. If so, the component will be identified by the author in the Item’s description page or in the Item’s downloaded files. The other license will apply to that component instead of this license. This license will apply to the rest of the Item.

>For example: A Module might contain images licensed under a Creative Commons CCBY license. The CCBY license applies to those specific images. This license applies to the rest of the Module.

11. For some items, a GNU General Public License (GPL) or another open source license applies. The open source license applies in the following ways:

- Some Items, even if entirely created by the author, may be partially subject to the open source license: a ‘split license’ applies. This means that the open source license applies to an extent that’s determined by the open source license terms and the nature of the Item, and this license applies to the rest of the Item.
>Split and other open source licensing is relevant for themes and extensions for Opencart and other open source platforms. Where split licensing applies, this is noted in the Item’s download files.

- For some Items, the author may have chosen to apply a GPL license to the entire Item. This means that the relevant GPL license will apply to the entire Item instead of this license.
>Where an Item is entirely under a GPL license, it will be identified as a GPL item and the license noted in the download files.

12. You can only use the Item for lawful purposes. Also, if an Item contains an image of a person, even if the Item is model-released you can’t use it in a way that creates a fake identity, implies personal endorsement of a product by the person, or in a way that is defamatory, obscene or demeaning, or in connection with sensitive subjects.

13. Items that contain digital versions of real products, trademarks or other intellectual property owned by others have not been property released. These Items are licensed on the basis of editorial use only. It is your responsibility to consider whether your use of these Items requires a clearance and if so, to obtain that clearance from the intellectual property rights owner.

14. This license can be terminated if you breach it. If that happens, you must stop making copies of or distributing the End Product until you remove the Item from it.

15. The author of the Item retains ownership of the Item but grants you the license on these terms. This license is between the author of the Item and you. Opencart Ltd is not a party to this license or the one giving you the license.
